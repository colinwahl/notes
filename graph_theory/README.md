These are my notes for MATH 4690: Graph Theory at The University of Georgia.

The course is taught by [Ben Lund](http://www.ben-lund.com/).

We are using the following text: [Pearls in Graph Theory: A Comprehensive Introduction](http://store.doverpublications.com/0486432327.html).
My initial impression of the book is positive.

You are free to do as you please with these notes.

As I write up the notes, I will attempt to index them by
1. Topic
2. Proof Technique
